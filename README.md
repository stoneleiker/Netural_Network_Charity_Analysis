# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
### The purpose of the project to use deep learning neural networks with the tensorflow in python, analyze if charitable donations

## Results
## Data Preprocessing
### The columns NAME is identifcation information and removed from the input data
### The column to use IS_SUCCESSFUL from variable is deep learning.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
### The Deep-learning is made of two hidden with neurons to speed the raining process and using function RELU and SIGMOID.
### The model accurary estimate is 57% not satisfying and not ready good to predict for charity donations.
## Summary
# The deep learning did not reach the target more than 70% accuracy so not meet average. Our accurary is below accuracy. That project won't help predict and know estimate.
